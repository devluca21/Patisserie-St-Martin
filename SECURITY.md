# Security Documentation

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables & Secrets
- ✅ API keys stored in environment variables (`BREVO_API_KEY`)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in source code
- ✅ `.env` files properly excluded from git tracking
- ✅ Environment variables validated before use

### 2. API Security
- ✅ Input validation on all API endpoints
- ✅ Enhanced rate limiting with IP blocking (10 requests/minute per IP)
- ✅ Suspicious activity detection and blocking
- ✅ No sensitive data in console logs
- ✅ HTTPS-only external API calls
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage

### 3. Security Headers
- ✅ `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- ✅ `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- ✅ `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- ✅ `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS
- ✅ `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features
- ✅ `Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- ✅ `Content-Security-Policy` - Comprehensive XSS and injection protection
- ✅ `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` - Prevents cross-origin data leaks
- ✅ `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` - Isolates browsing contexts
- ✅ `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` - Prevents cross-origin resource loading
- ✅ `Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?1` - Enhances origin isolation

### 4. Code Security
- ✅ No hardcoded URLs or endpoints
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- ✅ XSS attack pattern detection and blocking
- ✅ SQL/NoSQL injection detection and prevention
- ✅ Command injection detection and prevention
- ✅ Request size and content type validation
- ✅ File upload validation and sanitization
- ✅ Secure error messages (no internal details exposed)
- ✅ Input length limits to prevent DoS attacks

### 5. Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Next.js security best practices
- ✅ Enhanced middleware with suspicious request blocking
- ✅ Advanced threat detection (SQLMap, Nmap, Nikto, etc.)
- ✅ Query parameter injection detection
- ✅ Image optimization with secure patterns
- ✅ No sensitive files in public directory
- ✅ Bot and crawler blocking
- ✅ Suspicious referer blocking
- ✅ Security monitoring and metrics collection
- ✅ Real-time security event logging

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Rate Limiting
- Contact API: 10 requests/minute per IP
- Newsletter API: 5 requests/minute per IP
- General requests: 100 requests/minute per IP
- Headers: `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`

### Logging
- No sensitive data logged
- Rate limit violations logged
- API errors logged without exposing internal details
- Security events logged with severity levels
- Real-time threat detection logging

## 🚀 Additional Recommendations

### For Production
1. **Database Security**: Use connection pooling and prepared statements
2. **Authentication**: Implement JWT with proper expiration
3. **Monitoring**: Add security event logging and alerting
4. **Backups**: Regular encrypted backups with access controls
5. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated for security patches

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key_here
BREVO_NEWSLETTER_LIST_ID=your_list_id_here
BREVO_NOTIFY_EMAIL=your_notification_email@domain.com
SECURITY_API_TOKEN=your_security_monitoring_token_here
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Threat Detection
- **XSS Patterns**: Detects and blocks script injection attempts
- **SQL Injection**: Identifies database attack patterns
- **Command Injection**: Blocks system command attempts
- **Path Traversal**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Suspicious User Agents**: Blocks penetration testing tools
- **Malicious Referers**: Blocks known malicious domains

### Input Validation
- **Email Validation**: RFC-compliant email format checking
- **Phone Validation**: International phone number support
- **Name Validation**: Unicode character support with length limits
- **Message Validation**: Content length and pattern checking
- **Order Type Validation**: Whitelist-based validation

### Rate Limiting
- **IP-based Limiting**: Per-IP request counting
- **Endpoint-specific Limits**: Different limits for different APIs
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired rate limit records removed
- **Header Information**: Rate limit status in response headers

### Security Monitoring
- **Event Logging**: All security events logged with timestamps
- **Severity Levels**: Low, medium, high, critical event categorization
- **IP Tracking**: Source IP address logging for all events
